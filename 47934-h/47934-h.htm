throughout New England to whom the author
has had the pleasure of reciting it. Frequent requests
that he would place it in shape for preservation
have emboldened him to issue it in its present
dress. Painfully conscious of its defects as a literary
work, he sends it forth in search of old acquaintances,
trusting it may receive a share of that kindly favor
bestowed upon it as it fell from his lips.</p>

<h2>AN OLD MAN&rsquo;S PRAYER.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">In the loftiest room, of princely state,</div>
<div class="verse">Of a modern palace grand and great,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Whose marble front is a symbol true</div>
<div class="verse">Of the inner splendors hid from view,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">On an autumn night, when wild without</div>
<div class="verse">The bold winds held their revel rout,</div>
<div class="verse">Rudely assailing the passing throng,</div>
<div class="verse">Through churchyards creeping with mournful song,</div>
<div class="verse">A group was gathered around a board</div>
<div class="verse">Heaped with all that wealth could afford,</div>
<div class="verse">Or taste could suggest: dishes costly and rare,</div>
<div class="verse">Fruits of all climes and all seasons, were there.</div>
<div class="verse">The pendent lights in brilliance danced</div>
<div class="verse">On the gleaming plate their rays enhanced;</div>
<div class="verse">The massive mirrors thrice displayed</div>
<div class="verse">The stately banquet there arrayed.</div>
<div class="verse">Furniture carved by an artist hand,</div>
<div class="verse">Carpets which only great wealth could command,</div>
<div class="verse">Curtains of damask, of lace, and of gold,</div>
<div class="verse">Spoke of the splendors wealth could unfold,</div>
<div class="verse">And filled with a joy and a pleasure rare</div>
<div class="verse">The youthful hearts that were gathered there.</div>
<div class="verse">Slender each form, and fair each face,</div>
<div class="verse">Of the twelve gay lads which that table grace,</div>
<div class="verse">As with genial talk and pleasant jest</div>
<div class="verse">They banter each other, and cheer their guest.</div>
<div class="verse">For one guest is there, as youthful as they,</div>
<div class="verse">With a heart as light, and a voice as gay,</div>
<div class="verse">Who laughs at their jests with ready glee,</div>
<div class="verse">And whose quick returns speak a spirit free,</div>
<div class="verse">An honored guest; for, on the morrow,</div>
<div class="verse">They must part with him in pain and sorrow.</div>
<div class="verse">The glittering emblems his shoulders bear</div>
<div class="verse">Bid him for strife and for peril prepare;</div>
<div class="verse">Bid him go forth at his Country&rsquo;s call,</div>
<div class="verse">With her banner to triumph, or on it to fall.</div>
<div class="verse">A moment&rsquo;s pause, as with ready hand</div>
<div class="verse">The waiter hurries, at command,</div>
<div class="verse">To clear the table, and, instead</div>
<div class="verse">Of the rich, choice viands thickly spread,</div>
<div class="verse">Ranges dark bottles and cruses, which show</div>
<div class="verse">Marks of long years in damp vaults below.</div>
<div class="verse">The richest juices age can display</div>
<div class="verse">Are quickly spread in tempting array.</div>
<div class="verse">Wines of Bordeaux and Seville are there,</div>
<div class="verse">With liquors and cordials sparkling and rare;</div>
<div class="verse">And bottles are opened, and glasses are filled.</div>
<div class="verse">When all in a moment the tumult is stilled,</div>
<div class="verse">As he who presides with dignified grace</div>
<div class="verse">High raises his goblet, and stands in his place:&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">&ldquo;I give you, friends, no warrior&rsquo;s name</div>
<div class="verse">Your hearts to thrill, your blood to flame;</div>
<div class="verse">No toast to beauty shall my lips repeat,</div>
<div class="verse">Where we to-night in sacred friendship meet</div>
<div class="verse">To part with one, who, in our boyhood&rsquo;s days,</div>
<div class="verse">Earnest and true, won all our love and praise;</div>
<div class="verse">Who, on the morrow, plays the hero&rsquo;s part,</div>
<div class="verse">And seeks the battle with a loyal heart.</div>
<div class="verse">His health I give with an earnest prayer,</div>
<div class="verse">That, while on his mission of peril and care,</div>
<div class="verse">Success may be his, and, by deeds renowned,</div>
<div class="verse">He may meet us again with laurels crowned.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="verse">All glasses are raised, when a gentle hand</div>
<div class="verse">Is heard at the door&mdash;all silent stand</div>
<div class="verse">As it slowly opens, and into the light</div>
<div class="verse">An old man steps, his features bright:</div>
<div class="verse">The long white hairs o&rsquo;er his shoulders stream;</div>
<div class="verse">Like silver threads in the warm rays beam.</div>
<div class="verse">Wrinkled his brow, and pale his face,</div>
<div class="verse">Wasted his form, and tottering his pace,</div>
<div class="verse">Shrunken his cheek; but the eye above</div>
<div class="verse">Tells of gentleness, kindliness, love.</div>
<div class="verse">And silent stand all as he slowly seeks</div>
<div class="verse">A place near the table, and gently speaks:&mdash;</div>
</div>

</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&ldquo;Young men, but a moment I check your mirth,</div>
<div class="verse">And bring you back to the common earth.</div>
<div class="verse">Unbidden I come with an old man&rsquo;s prayer:</div>
<div class="verse">May it seek your hearts, and gain entrance there!</div>
<div class="verse">Look on my face, seamed, not with crime,</div>
<div class="verse">But with marks of age before their time:</div>
<div class="verse">These long white hairs should not have shown</div>
<div class="verse">Till ten more years had by me flown.</div>
<div class="verse">Age is upon me; not age by years,</div>
<div class="verse">But age by sorrow and care and tears;</div>
<div class="verse">Not age that cheers as it draweth near</div>
<div class="verse">Yon heaven which seemeth more bright and clear,</div>
<div class="verse">But age which causes the heart to lag</div>
<div class="verse">In its onward course, and the spirit to flag;</div>
<div class="verse">That prays for death as but a release</div>
<div class="verse">From earthly care, and finds no peace</div>
<div class="verse">In that sweet belief that at last I hail,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">&lsquo;There is rest for the weary beyond the vale.&rsquo;</div>
<div class="verse">For to me has come a spirit of light,</div>
<div class="verse">Bringing the morning, and chasing the night;</div>
<div class="verse">Causing my heart with joy to swell</div>
<div class="verse">To my Maker, &lsquo;who doeth all things well.&rsquo;</div>
<div class="verse">You shall hear my story: &rsquo;twill not be long,</div>
<div class="verse">And may guard you all from sin and from wrong.</div>
<div class="verse">I had wealth and plenty in goodly lands,</div>
<div class="verse">In houses and cattle; and from my hands</div>
<div class="verse">Many were fed; and many were they</div>
<div class="verse">Who partook of my charity day by day.</div>
<div class="verse">My house was open to stranger and friend;</div>
<div class="verse">And my gold did I lavishly, freely spend.</div>
<div class="verse">But one bitter curse did my wealth uprear</div>
<div class="verse">To poison my life,&mdash;the tempter here,</div>
<div class="verse">The sparkling demon, which now I see</div>
<div class="verse">From all your glasses glaring on me,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">A monster who steals on its prey so slow,</div>
<div class="verse">That it has your life before you know</div>
<div class="verse">Or dream of its power: this was the curse</div>
<div class="verse">That sat at my fire-side, robbed my purse,</div>
<div class="verse">Poisoned my life, and left me to be</div>
<div class="verse">A drifting log on the world&rsquo;s wide sea,</div>
<div class="verse">Ruined and bankrupt, lost and bereft;</div>
<div class="verse">No kindred, no fortune, no treasure, left.</div>
<div class="verse">Treasure!&mdash;yes; for I had three sons,</div>
<div class="verse">The hope of my life,&mdash;three noble ones.</div>
<div class="verse">You shall hear their fate, and then I&rsquo;ll away,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor longer your hour of pleasure delay.</div>
</div>

</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">One sought as a merchant hopeful to clear</div>
<div class="verse">Our tarnished name, to again uprear</div>
<div class="verse">Our shattered house; but, sad to say,</div>
<div class="verse">The curse of the wine-cup was in his way.</div>
<div class="verse">He seized on it madly, drank deep and fast,</div>
<div class="verse">And sank to the drunkard&rsquo;s grave at last.</div>
<div class="verse">I stood by his side as with frenzy wild</div>
<div class="verse">He cursed himself and his wife and child;</div>
<div class="verse">He cursed me too, as the one who had led</div>
<div class="verse">His feet in the path that drunkards tread;</div>
<div class="verse">And then&mdash;it was worse than all beside&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">He cursed his Maker; and then&mdash;he died!</div>

<a name="fig5" id="fig5"></a><img src="images/005.jpg" width="442" height="600" alt="Ruined and Bankrupt" />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Another, with spirit that loved to brave,</div>
<div class="verse">Sought a bold, free life on the ocean-wave.</div>
<div class="verse">He left my side full of life and health,</div>
<div class="verse">In a good stanch ship, in search of wealth.</div>
<div class="verse">A twelvemonth passed, and day by day</div>
<div class="verse">I scanned for his sail the distant bay.</div>
<div class="verse">At last I saw it, and eagerly flew</div>
<div class="verse">To welcome my boy so manly and true.</div>
<div class="verse">But, alas! he was gone: no son to greet</div>
<div class="verse">My waiting heart came with eager feet.</div>
<div class="verse">But they told me there,&mdash;one stormy night,</div>
<div class="verse">When the heavens were filled with angry light,</div>
<div class="verse">The waves rolled high, and the winds beat wild,</div>
<div class="verse">That out on a frail yard went my child;</div>
<div class="verse">He had drunk deep, and &rsquo;twas fearful to sweep</div>
<div class="verse">On that slender spar o&rsquo;er the seething deep;</div>
<div class="verse">That one heavy sea tossed the ship like a toy,</div>
<div class="verse">And hurled from his hold my darling boy.</div>
<div class="verse">Then I sank me down in agony wild,</div>
<div class="verse">And glared on the waves that rolled over my child:</div>
<div class="verse">I gazed until in the waters blue</div>
<div class="verse">I saw reflected the brilliant hue</div>
<div class="verse">Of one lone star, which, high above,</div>
<div class="verse">Seemed to speak to my heart of faith and love;</div>
<div class="verse">And I thought, as I turned my eyes to its light.</div>
<div class="verse">It beckoned me on to the heavens so bright,</div>
<div class="verse">Where I know, whenever this life shall cease,</div>
<div class="verse">I shall meet my boy in eternal peace.</div>

</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I had but one left; and him I taught</div>
<div class="verse">To shun each sinful word and thought;</div>
<div class="verse">To beware of the wine-cup&rsquo;s demon lure,</div>
<div class="verse">That would steel his heart, and his soul obscure.</div>
<div class="verse">He took the way of life that leads</div>
<div class="verse">To the sacred desk where the preacher pleads,</div>
<div class="verse">And placed his foot on the pulpit stair,</div>
<div class="verse">The gospel&mdash;banner of life&mdash;to bear.</div>
<div class="verse">When the cannon&rsquo;s boom o&rsquo;er Sumter broke,</div>
<div class="verse">And the air was filled with traitorous smoke;</div>
<div class="verse">When brave men sprang with willing hearts</div>
<div class="verse">To their Country&rsquo;s flag to repel the darts</div>
<div class="verse">Which treason had hurled with malice wild</div>
<div class="verse">At the life of the mother, so good and mild,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">My boy stepped down from the preacher&rsquo;s stand,</div>
<div class="verse">And started forth, with life in hand,</div>
<div class="verse">To sell it dear, but to battle strong</div>
<div class="verse">With the loyal North against fearful wrong.</div>
<div class="verse">I know that he carries a magic spell</div>
<div class="verse">&rsquo;Gainst the curse of our race to guard him well;</div>
<div class="verse">And I know, should he fall, his death will be</div>
<div class="verse">In the foremost ranks of loyalty.</div>
<div class="verse">And now, young men, an old man&rsquo;s prayer:&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Leave the bright wine in your glasses there;</div>
<div class="verse">Shun its allurements; for in its deep red</div>
<div class="verse">Is the blood of its victims dying and dead.</div>
<div class="verse">Fill up your glasses, and pledge your friend</div>
<div class="verse">In the crystal stream that Heaven doth send.&rdquo;</div>

</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">With a lowly bow, and the same meek air,</div>
<div class="verse">He has passed the door, and adown the stair;</div>
<div class="verse">While those he has left to their leader turn</div>
<div class="verse">With downcast eyes, and cheeks that burn.</div>
<div class="verse">Silent he stands as his glass he takes,</div>
<div class="verse">When the guest of the evening the silence breaks.</div>
<div class="verse">&ldquo;Friends of my boyhood, the old man&rsquo;s prayer</div>
<div class="verse">Shall meet a response in the heart I wear.</div>
<div class="verse">I come to-night from a mother&rsquo;s side:</div>
<div class="verse">She watches my life with a parent&rsquo;s pride;</div>
<div class="verse">And I know &rsquo;tis the dearest wish of her heart,</div>
<div class="verse">In camp and in battle to keep me apart</div>
<div class="verse">From sin and temptation; unceasing will pray</div>
<div class="verse">Heaven&rsquo;s blessing to guard on my perilous way.</div>
<div class="verse">And this pledge will I leave her,&mdash;never again</div>
<div class="verse">My lips with the wine-cup&rsquo;s poison to stain.</div>
<div class="verse">So, friends, let&rsquo;s drink to our meeting again:</div>
<div class="verse">My drink is the water, free from all stain.&rdquo;</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He stood with his upraised glass, and the light</div>
<div class="verse">Full on his fair young brow beamed bright,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">That brow which an anxious mother would kiss</div>
<div class="verse">With a pure, deep feeling of heartfelt bliss;</div>
<div class="verse">And along the line of his comrades young,</div>
<div class="verse">To honor his toast, each hand upsprung:</div>
<div class="verse">In not one glass did the red wine gleam;</div>
<div class="verse">But all were filled from the crystal stream.</div>

<div class="verse">On the morrow, adown the street,</div>
<div class="verse">With trumpet&rsquo;s blast and war-drum&rsquo;s beat,</div>
<div class="verse">Firm and erect, with martial tread,</div>
<div class="verse">The flag of their Country overhead,</div>
<div class="verse">With brave, stout hearts, and patriot-song,</div>

<div class="verse">Light is his heart; his faith is strong;</div>
<div class="verse">Bright gleams his sword as he moves along:</div>

<div class="verse">Is the shield of Temperance guarding his breast.</div>
